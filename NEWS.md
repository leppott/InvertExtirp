  - No vignettes planned at this time.

# v0.0.1.9003

2018-04-12

  - fish.wt.cdf, Example
      - Updated group WS\_Area to WS\_AREA to match example data.
      - Updated example function to include groups and xvar.
      - Updated example SampleID from FishInvertID to Station\_Date.

# v0.0.1.9002

    modifications to code.

# v0.0.1.9001

2017-04-25

  - Added area under the curve functions (auc.response() and
    auc.tolerance()) as independant functions. Removed code from the
    other functions (taxon.response(), taxon.response.sort(), and
    tolerance()).

# v0.0.1.0000

2017-04-24

  - Updated documentation to a whole number version and created a
    “release” on GitHub.

# v0.0.0.9006

2017-04-24

  - Removed fish.gam(). It is designed for another purpose.

  - fish.wt.cdf(). Was previously named weighted.fish.cdf().

# v0.0.0.9005

2017-04-18

  - taxon.response(). Tweaked for example. Added and documented data
    files (QC\_Benthic.txt and Env\_metrics.txt as species and
    envdata.all). Added “mgcv::” to “gam().” and “Hmisc::” to
    “wtd.quantile” and “Ecdf”.

# v0.0.0.9004

2017-04-14

  - Revised comment strings in scripts so will properly outline in
    RStudio; curve.shape.R, fish.wt.cdf.R, taxon.response.R,
    taxaon.response.sort.R, and tolerance.R. Also modified data prep
    files in raw data.

  - tolerance(). Tweaked for example. Added data files (tol.ss and
    tol.env.data). Added “mgcv::” to “gam().” and “Hmisc::” to
    “wtd.quantile”. Created data from raw files and documented.

# v0.0.0.9003

2017-04-06

  - taxon.response.sort(). Process raw data. Add data files df1.rda and
    taxalist.rda. Add library mgcv reference for gam(). Updated data.R
    for df1 and taxalist.

  - Added new function dir.check.add() to ensure output folders exist.

  - DESCRIPTION. Add mgcv to Imports.

# v0.0.0.9002

2017-04-05

  - Rename package from InvertExtirp to XC95. Update DESCRIPTION, NEWS,
    and README.

  - Add data to use with examples.

  - Added raw data for weightcdf(). Included script for creating the RDA
    files.

  - Added documentation for the above data files (ss and bio.sample).

# v0.0.0.9001

2017-04-04

  - Update the R files for readability, documentation, and dependant
    packages for the functions. “tolerance\_cov.R” requires the
    “reshape” package (update one call to reshape::cast and add to
    DESCRIPTION).

  - Rename “tolerance\_cov.R” to “tolerance.R” to match the function.

# v0.0.0.9000

2017-03-29

  - Created GitHub repository.

  - Added ReadME.RMD and NEWS.RMD

  - 7 functions; curve.shape, fish.gam, fish.wt.cdf, taxon.response,
    taxon.response.sort, tolerance\_cov, weightedcdf2.
